      <p>
        I'm a passionate developer with a love for creating engaging digital
        experiences. My journey in coding began from a young age, at a coding
        camp in Ann Arbor, and I've since dedicated myself to learning and
        growing in this ever-evolving field. Below are some endeavors I'm
        particularly proud of.

          <h4>Dijkstra Travel Guide</h4>
          <p>
            Developed with a group CS400, this project utilizes Dijkstras
            algorithm to help travelers plan out their trips. Using a weighted
            graph with the vertexs representing airports and the edge weights
            representing distance, our algorithm computes the shortest path from
            travelers current airport to their destination.

          <h4>Check out my Github!</h4>
          <p>
            My Github contains a small subset of projects I've worked on outside
            of school and for my classes. I am constantly experimenting with new
            frameworks and technologies, which fuels my passion for software
            development. Some of these projects are mere experiments and others
            have become more structured projects.
